![Checkout Times by Users](./Resources/Slide1.png)

Trip duration peaks between 4-6 hours for most users.

![Checkout Times by Gender](./Resources/Slide2.png)

The peak of trip duration is the same for both male and females, however there are significantly more male users than female users.

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](./Resources/Slide3.png)

Thursday evenings are the most popular, between 5-6pm. Followed by Thursdays at 8am and Mondays & Tuesdays between 5-6pm.

The busiest usage timeframes for males are consistant with the previous heatmap. For females, it is difficult to determine when they use the bikes most. Taking an attempt, they peak on weekdays from 8-9am, and Mondays/Thursday 5-7pm.

![Gender Breakdown](./Resources/Slide5.png)

Indicated male users make up nearly 2/3 of total users.

There appears to be more subscribers than regular customers, again, majority males. Subscribers are more active Thursdays and Fridays.

Nearly 80% of trips are taken by subscribers.


## Summary

Overall males are the biggest consumers for this business, and Thursday and Friday evenings are when they have the most activity. Subsciption services are very popular among users which is a good indication of consistant income. If I were to add more visualizations, I would focus on the age range of usage for the Trips taken.
